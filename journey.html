            <!-- F1 in Schools Information -->
            <section class="f1-info">
                <h3>What is F1 in Schools?</h3>
                <p><strong>Started in 1999 in the UK and endorsed by F1, F1 in Schools is a global competition designed to immerse students in STEM subjects through the exciting world of motorsports.</strong></p>
                <p>The challenge requires students to design, build, and race miniature F1 cars, managing every aspect from CAD design to 3D printing and assembly.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Our Journey -->
            <section class="our-journey">
                <h3>Our Journey</h3>

                <!-- Initial Phase -->
                <h4>Initial Phase</h4>
                <p><strong>Starting from scratch, we went through all the requirements documented on the official F1 in Schools website.</strong> This phase involved a deep dive into understanding competition rules, required deliverables, and expectations. We dedicated a lot of time to research, planning, and laying down a strong foundation for our journey.</p>

                <!-- Team Meetings and Ideation -->
                <h4>Team Meetings and Ideation</h4>
                <p><strong>We held multiple team meetings to brainstorm ideas and plan out our approach.</strong> During these sessions, we discussed everything from potential car designs to the roles of each team member. Our focus was on creating an innovative, aerodynamic design that could be competitive on the track while also being visually appealing.</p>

                <!-- CAD Design and Development -->
                <h4>CAD Design and Development</h4>
                <p><strong>We then moved on to the CAD design stage, where we developed our car prototypes using advanced CAD software.</strong> This was one of the most challenging and rewarding stages, as we iterated on several design ideas and pushed ourselves to improve our skills in design and engineering. Every detail mattered â€“ from aerodynamics to weight distribution.</p>

                <!-- Paddock Tour Experience -->
                <h4>F1 Singapore Grand Prix Paddock Tour</h4>
                <p><strong>One of the highlights of our journey was getting the chance to go on a paddock tour for the F1 Singapore Grand Prix practice session.</strong> This experience gave us valuable insights into the real world of Formula 1 and motivated us to push our project even further. Seeing the actual F1 cars up close and the high level of technology involved was inspiring for our entire team.</p>

                <!-- Sponsorship and Pitching -->
                <h4>Sponsorship and Pitching</h4>
                <p><strong>Throughout the journey, we also worked on pitching our project and reaching out to potential sponsors.</strong> This involved sending numerous emails, creating presentations, and building relationships with businesses interested in supporting our project. It was an excellent learning experience, teaching us communication, marketing, and how to effectively convey our team's vision to others.</p>
